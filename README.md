Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

The WeatherPy portion of this project involves analyzing weather data using OpenWeather API and Geoapify. Weatherpy is built using Python and includes tthe use of Matplotlib to assist in manipulating the raw data. Charts are included to assist in analyzing the data.

The VacationPy portion of the project utilizes Weatherpy and Geoapify to construct a map that shows dots on a map that are proportional to data found in Weatherpy. The map also shows the first hotel within 10,000 meters from the cities generated in Weatherpy.
